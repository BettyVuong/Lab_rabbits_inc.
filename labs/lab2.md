# Brainstorming Requirements & User Stories

Organize and Categorize
- Once you have your user stories, organize them into categories. Suggested approaches:
    - By stakeholder (e.g., student).
    - By ITS model or feature (e.g., tutoring model)
    - By priority (must-have, should-have, nice-to-have).
