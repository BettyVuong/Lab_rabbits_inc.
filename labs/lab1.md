**Purpose & Scope**

This contract breaks down how our team will plan, build, and deliver the final assignment for CIS\*3750 Fall semester. It highlights the shared expectations made within our group regarding communication, roles, meetings, task ownership, attendance and absence policy, accountability and strike policy, decision-making, and conflict resolution.

**Tools & Communication Platforms**

Communication will be done over a Discord server with additional communication through email in scenarios where deemed necessary. Trello will hold the requirements and progress of the assignment (to do, doing, done, etc.). Finally, GitLab will be where our code will be stored and shared.

**Roles & Responsibilities**

Over the course of the project, new roles and responsibilities may arise which will be discussed at subsequent group meetings. For the time being, the roles are as follows:

- Note Taker: In charge of tracking meeting attendance and taking notes during meetings. Meeting notes should be uploaded to the Discord Server and Trello within 2 hours of the meeting conclusion unless otherwise agreed upon by the group. This role is to be rotated among the group members on a weekly basis.

- Team Lead: In charge of delegating tasks and requirements. Leads meetings and ensures the group is staying on task and focusing. Considers the bigger picture of the project and brings up concerns regarding requirement difficulty and completion rate.

- Technical Lead: In charge of looking at the technical aspects of the project. Helps out with debugging when needed and overviews requirement difficulty and completion rate.

**Weekly Meeting Structure**

The team will meet on a weekly basis during the Monday Lab session (2:30pm - 4:20pm). Friday check-in will occur at 5:45pm via Discord voice chat for up to an hour to touch base on member tasks and progress. During the Friday meeting, redistribution of work will occur if problems arise (ie. group members not doing work, requirement is harder than initially thought, etc.).

This is what the general meeting structure will look like:

- Attendance is taken, Team Lead will go over the meeting agenda

- Start with team Stand Up

  - Answer Weekly Reflection Prompts

  - Share any questions, comments, or concerns → will be addressed after the standup, note taker should be noting for later follow-up

- Team Lead will go over the remaining agenda points

  - Anyone who would like to contribute or has points to add, should send their name into the Live Meeting channel on Discord where either the Team Lead or Note Taker will allow them to speak \[for online meetings only]

- Go over questions/comments/concerns from earlier → save for last incase they get addressed by others organically or the team agenda

**Attendance, Absences & Notice**

If a member will not be able to attend any meeting due to unforeseen circumstances, this should be communicated to the group at least 24 hours prior to the start time of the meeting. You will also need to provide a written update of your progress on your assigned goal for the week prior to the meeting. The team member will also have the opportunity to meet with the team lead at a later time to discuss any concerns.

**Accountability & Strike Policy**

This policy stands for both absences and undelivered work. 

1. Strike 1: A 1-on-1 constructive conversation will take place with the team lead

2. Strike 2: A group discussion will take place to decide the best course of action given the situation circumstances

3. Strike 3: Matters will be escalated to the professor and teaching assistants.

**Workflow & Work Requirements**

A task is marked done when the requirements for the goal have been successfully reached. Tasks will be distributed based on each individual member's skill set. These skills should be listed in the Team Profile- document, which can be found on the Trello and Discord server. Any members struggling with aspects of their assigned goals can reach out to the Technical Lead for further assistance. 

**Decision-making & Technical Governance**

Any issues that arise with the development of requirements and such are to be discussed with the team. The Technical Lead should provide further feedback and assistance in determining if requirements need to be changed or further broken up. For decision-making, a general team consensus should be taken. 

**Documentation & Artifacts**

All documentation and artifacts will be stored either on the Discord server or Trello. Meeting notes can be found on both (Discord → meeting notes channel, Trello, Meeting Notes card), miscellaneous documents can be found on Trello under the Documents card. Code will be stored on GitLab. All documents should be made accessible on all platforms 2 hours following the meeting’s adjournment. 

**Conflict Resolution Process**

During each meeting, each member will have the opportunity to bring up any questions, comments, or concerns they may have regarding the project or team dynamics. Any conflicts are first encouraged to be discussed 1:1 with the appropriate parties, but if the conflict remains unresolved, it should be brought up to the team to be further discussed and resolved. 

**Weekly Reflection Prompts**

During each meeting, members are in charge of answering the following questions:

- What was your task this past week?

- Has it been completed? If not, why?

- Was there anything you struggled with?

- What is the next step in the process?

- Do you need additional help?
